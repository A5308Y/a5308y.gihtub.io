<h1>The Mission</h1>
Excellence Through Accidents gives you software development patterns applied in a Ruby on Rails environment. It cares about subjectively beautiful code more than about measurable benefits and it wants to be a light read.

I don't consider myself an expert on patterns or on Rails. I want to use this blog to help me be motivated to discoverÂ concepts and tools and to learn to better express my thoughts on programming. I'l be honest here and won't try to hide when I don't know something.
<h1>The Name</h1>
Using software development patterns can feel like magic in my opinion. You keep to a small set of simple rules and suddenly you end up with well designed software that's easy to change and just beautiful to look at. At least that's the theory. So in theory excellent code can end up feeling like it came to be accidentally. I may also just like the sound of Excellence Through Accidents.
